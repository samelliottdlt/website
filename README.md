This is a personal Next.js site that houses my side projects.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start a development server with hot reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

Before building, linting runs automatically. To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Run the production server after building:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Code Quality

Check lint rules:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Validate formatting with Prettier:

```bash
npm run prettier
```

Automatically fix formatting issues:

```bash
npm run prettier:fix
```

## Testing

Run the Jest test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

Debug tests with the Node inspector:

```bash
npm run test:inspect
```
